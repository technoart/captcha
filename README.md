Captcha Integration Library

It’s very simple PHP based Captcha Generator Class where you required minimal coding. 

It’s a session based Captcha Verification System.

How to use:

Place the folder to appropriate location of your website.

Open index.php file and check the html code. 

Copy the html image tag [<img  src=””  /> ] and paste it where you want to display the captcha image.

Reset the Image [ <img src=”” >] SRC location path to the getCaptcha.php file.

Open the getCaptcha.php file and change the $_SESSION variable index name, what you want to use in your project.

Run and check were the captcha image is generated or not.

If Not then please recheck the all source path.

If you got the captcha image then open the CaptchaGenerator.Class.php file and update the all default values according to your requirement.

Note:  its require PHP GD image library. Generally it’s available in all php versions.
